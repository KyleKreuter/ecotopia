# Ecotopia — Framing

## The Project in One Sentence

Ecotopia is an AI-native strategy game where players must solve the climate crisis as mayor — not through optimal clicks, but through honest communication with AI-generated citizens who remember every word.

## Framing Strategy

### Don't Frame It Like This

| Wrong Framing | Why It Hurts |
|---|---|
| "A climate game" | Sounds like guilt and sacrifice. Scares off the audience you actually want to reach. |
| "An educational game" | Kills any willingness to pay. Nobody wants to be lectured. |
| "An AI demo" | Reduces the game to technology. Forgets the emotional impact. |
| "SimCity with AI" | Sets wrong expectations. Ecotopia isn't a city builder — it's a communication game. |
| "An indie game" | Too generic. Says nothing about the unique mechanics. |

### Frame It Like This

**Primary Framing: "The first game where your words have consequences."**

Ecotopia is a communication strategy game. The player makes decisions on a map — but the real move happens afterward: when you explain to your citizens why you did what you did. In your own words. No multiple choice. And the citizens never forget.

**Secondary Framing: "Papers Please meets the climate crisis."**

Moral dilemmas with human faces. Not abstract, but personal. It's easy to delete a red square on a map. It's hard to tell a 54-year-old oil rig worker to his face why his job is gone.

## The Three Core Narratives

### 1. The Promise Mechanic — "They remember every word you said."

The strongest unique selling point. No other game tracks the player's free-form statements and confronts them with it. The player promises in round 2: "Oleg, I'll find you a job." In round 4, the opposition politician quotes them verbatim — whether they delivered or not.

**Why it captivates:** Everyone knows broken political promises. Here you experience for the first time what it feels like — from the other side.

### 2. Dynamic Citizens — "Your decisions create people."

Tear down the oil refinery, and you meet Oleg — 54 years old, 20 years of refinery experience, angry and scared. Build a solar field, and you meet Lena — 28, technician, optimistic. These people aren't scripted. They're created by the AI in real time, with context-relevant personality, biography, and opinion.

**Why it captivates:** The game makes abstract statistics human. The economy bar doesn't just drop by 5% — a real person loses their job and stands before you.

### 3. The Thesis — "Progress has a human cost."

The game has a clear message that the player discovers through failure. On the first attempt, you fail through radical change. On the second, you understand: research first. On the third, you understand: honesty — even toward the losers of transition — is the key.

**Why it captivates:** No finger-wagging. The game doesn't lecture — it lets the player experience the insight themselves.

## Audience-Specific Framing

### Gamers (Primary)

**Framing:** A narrative strategy game with an unprecedented mechanic.
**Language:** "Free text input", "your words have consequences", "no two playthroughs are the same"
**Comparisons:** Papers Please, Frostpunk, Disco Elysium
**Don't say:** "Educational game", "climate change", "sustainability" — avoid these words in marketing

### Press / Content Creators

**Framing:** The first truly AI-native game mechanic — not AI as gimmick, but AI as core loop.
**Language:** "Promise Extraction", "dynamic NPCs", "contradiction detection"
**Pitch Angle:** "What happens when a game holds you to your word?"
**Story Hook:** A single playthrough delivers enough material for a 20-minute video.

### Investors / Publishers

**Framing:** AI-native gaming IP with viral mechanics and cultural relevance.
**Language:** "Replayability through AI", "no content plateau", "emergent narratives"
**Key Metrics:** Every playthrough is unique. Promise tracking as viral sharing moment. Low content costs through AI-generated narratives.
**Market Timing:** Climate debate is zeitgeist. AI gaming is the next platform shift.

### Education / Serious Games

**Framing:** A simulation space for political communication and climate policy.
**Language:** "Empathy training", "perspective shifting", "systems thinking"
**Use Cases:** Political science classes, ethics seminars, leadership training
**But:** Never use this framing as the primary angle — it kills consumer appeal.

## Elevator Pitches by Context

### 30 Seconds (Networking)

> "Ecotopia is a strategy game where you're the mayor of a city on the brink of ecological collapse. The twist: after every decision, you have to explain to your citizens in your own words why you did what you did. And they never forget. Your promises are tracked, your contradictions exposed, and new citizens appear — people whose lives you just changed."

### 10 Seconds (Elevator)

> "A game where you have to solve the climate crisis — but the real fight is honestly explaining to your citizens why someone just lost their job."

### 1 Sentence (Social Media)

> "What if a game tracked every promise you made — and confronted you with it?"

## Visual Framing

### Key Art Direction

No green eco-aesthetic. No warm feel-good green. Instead: the map as bird's-eye view, below it citizen portraits with speech bubbles. The tension between the abstract grid above and the concrete faces below — that's the visual leitmotif.

### Color Palette

- **Map:** Muted colors, slightly desaturated — no cartoon
- **Citizens:** Warm, human tones — contrast to the cold map
- **UI:** Dark, minimalist — focus stays on map and text
- **Accent:** The speech input text field glows — it's the most important part of the game

### Tonality

Serious, but not depressing. Emotional, but not manipulative. The game doesn't say "it's your fault." It says: "This is the cost of progress — and you decide how you deal with it."

## What Ecotopia Is NOT

- **Not a city builder.** It's not about building the perfect city. It's about making hard decisions and standing by them.
- **Not a climate simulator.** The ecology mechanics are deliberately simplified. The complexity lies in the human dimension.
- **Not an AI chatbot with a game wrapper.** The AI is deeply integrated into the game mechanics — promise extraction, contradiction detection, dynamic NPCs. Without AI, this game is impossible.
- **Not a moral preacher.** The game has a thesis, but no finger-wagging. The insight comes through play, not through lectures.
