I promise to implement a city-wide recycling program within the next five years, reducing our waste output and improving our ecological footprint. This is an immediate action that we can and will take. By round 3, I pledge to invest in renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and stimulate economic growth through green jobs. In the same timeframe, I commit to providing tax breaks for companies that adopt eco-friendly practices, which may negatively impact our short-term revenue but will foster a sustainable economy in the long run. By round 5, I assure you that we will have established a research center dedicated to developing new green technologies, positioning our city as a leader in ecological innovation. However, this will require significant funding, which could potentially divert resources from other areas. Lastly, by the end of my term, I vow to have transformed our public transportation system into a fully electric fleet, reducing air pollution and enhancing our quality of life.
