Detect contradictions between words and actions. Rules: Explicit promises use 'I promise', 'I guarantee', 'I will', 'You have my word'. Implicit promises are statements implying commitment ('The forest stays', 'No more factories'). Extract target_citizen if promise is directed at someone. Extract deadline_round if mentioned. NOT a promise: opinions, descriptions, questions. Confidence 0.0-1.0. For contradictions: compare speech with actions, severity low/medium/high.
